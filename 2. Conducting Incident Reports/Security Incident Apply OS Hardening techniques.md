# Incident Report of Applying Operating System hardening techniques

## Objective

This portfolio showcases a Incident report of how to apply Operating System hardening techniques. This was completed during the Google Professional Cybersecurity Certificate program. This project demonstrate my ability to write techical reports outlining the incident that has occured, assess the risk, and provide information for rectification of the incident. The goal is to highlight skills relevant to roles in cybersecurity.

### Skills Learned

#### Understanding of TCP/IP Protocol Suite

- In-depth knowledge of the TCP three-way handshake and its role in reliable communication.
- Ability to analyze and interpret TCP-related logs and connection errors.
- Awareness of how TCP SYN Flood attacks exploit protocol vulnerabilities.

#### Attack Analysis

- Identification of attack types (e.g., TCP SYN Flood).
- Understanding of how malicious actors manipulate network protocols to disrupt services.
- Differentiation between legitimate and malicious network behavior based on log data.
  
#### Log Analysis

- Analyzing server logs to pinpoint anomalies such as suspicious IP addresses (e.g., 203.0.113.0).
- Interpreting logs to identify attack vectors and determine their impact on server functionality.
- Recognizing patterns of malicious behavior in network traffic.

#### Threat Mitigation

- Proposing practical defenses against attacks, such as configuring firewalls and behavior-based anomaly detection.
- Recommending strategies to prevent and manage Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, including resource allocation and server hardening.
- Emphasizing the importance of intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) in mitigating such incidents.

#### Understanding of Firewalls

- Knowledge of how firewalls can analyze and filter traffic based on IP addresses and behavior.
- Suggesting configurations to block malicious traffic, such as blocking specific IP addresses or monitoring for suspicious patterns.

#### DoS/DDoS Attack Knowledge

- Familiarity with different types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and their mechanisms.
- Understanding the distinction between DoS and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- Awareness of how such attacks can overwhelm server resources and disrupt functionality.
  
#### Packet Analysis

- Expertise in examining packets for unusual activity, such as repeated SYN packets without final acknowledgment.
- Proficiency with tools like Wireshark or tcpdump for monitoring and capturing network packets.
  
#### Network Security Best Practices

- Recognizing the importance of proactive measures such as rate limiting, SYN cookies, and other countermeasures to mitigate attacks.
- Awareness of modern security practices to safeguard against TCP SYN Floods and other network-level attacks.
